# python-list
This Python script demonstrates various list operations step by step, modifying my_list dynamically:

1. Creates an empty list → my_list = []
2. Appends elements 10, 20, 30, 40 to the list.
3. Inserts 15 at index 1, shifting existing elements forward.
4. Extends the list with [50, 60, 70], adding multiple elements at once.
5. Removes the last element using pop(), effectively deleting 70.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order with sort().
7. Finds and prints the index of 30 using index(30).
## Key Features:
✔️ Covers list creation, insertion, extension, sorting, and deletion.
✔️ Demonstrates index lookup in a list.
✔️ Outputs a sorted list and the index of 30.
